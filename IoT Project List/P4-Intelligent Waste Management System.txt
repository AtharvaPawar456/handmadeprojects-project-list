2. SmartWasteGuard

Problem Statement: Conventional waste collection methods are inefficient and contribute to environmental issues due to irregular collection routes and overflowing bins.

Abstract: The Intelligent Waste Management System project focuses on leveraging IoT technology and data analytics to optimize waste collection and reduce environmental impact. By employing smart bins, real-time monitoring, and predictive analytics, this system aims to revolutionize waste management.

Description: This project entails deploying a network of smart bins equipped with sensors (ultrasonic, gas, etc.) to monitor fill levels, air quality, and other parameters. The collected data is transmitted to a central web application built using Django, where waste collection routes are optimized using machine learning algorithms. The platform enables waste management companies to minimize costs, reduce carbon footprint, and improve urban cleanliness.

Features:
- Smart bins with ultrasonic sensors for accurate fill level measurement.
- Gas sensors for monitoring air quality and detecting harmful emissions.
- Predictive analytics for optimizing waste collection routes.
- Real-time monitoring of bin status, fill levels, and environmental conditions.
- Alerts for timely waste collection and preventive maintenance.
- Web application dashboard for waste management visualization.
- Reduction of operational costs and improved resource allocation.
- Eco-friendly practices for sustainable waste collection.

Technology Used:
- Django: Web application development for real-time monitoring and data visualization.
- Machine Learning: Algorithms for route optimization and predictive analytics.
- IoT: Smart bins with integrated sensors and communication capabilities.
- ESP32: Microcontroller for sensor integration and data transmission.
