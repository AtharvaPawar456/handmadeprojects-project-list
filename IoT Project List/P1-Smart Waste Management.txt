Project: Smart Waste Management (IoT)

Topic: Smart Waste Management using IoT technology.

Subtopic: Efficient waste management system utilizing IoT devices and technologies.

Problem Statement: Inefficient waste management leads to environmental pollution and resource wastage. Traditional waste collection methods lack real-time data and optimization.

Abstract: The Smart Waste Management project aims to address waste management challenges by implementing an IoT-based solution. This system utilizes sensors, data analysis, and automation to enhance waste collection and disposal processes.

Description: This project involves deploying IoT sensors in waste bins across the city. These sensors monitor the fill level of the bins and transmit real-time data to a central web application. Using machine learning algorithms, the system predicts optimal collection routes and schedules, reducing fuel consumption and operational costs.

Features:
- Real-time monitoring of waste bin fill levels.
- Intelligent route optimization for waste collection trucks.
- Notification system for timely collection.
- Web application dashboard for monitoring and management.

Technology Used:
- Django: Web application development.
- Machine Learning: Route optimization and predictive analysis.
- IoT: Interconnected sensors and data communication.
- ESP32: IoT microcontroller for sensor integration.
- LED and Servo: Indicators for bin status and collection.
- Ultrasonic Sensor: To measure the waste level in bin.

Application: Municipalities, waste management companies, and urban planners can benefit from this system. It optimizes waste collection processes, reduces costs, and promotes a cleaner environment.

Future Use:
- Integration with smart city initiatives for comprehensive urban management.
- Expansion to include additional sensors for environmental monitoring.
- Collaboration with waste-to-energy projects for sustainable waste utilization.
- Reward system, rewarded when waste is collected.
